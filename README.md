#Tic Tac Toe

I decided to push my limits by creating a Tic Tac Toe game that I've named TTT+. This game is designed for two players. Each player has a 10-second limit; 
the first one to reach the 10-second mark loses. There is an active timer that acts like a stopwatch for each player. Player O gets half of the screen for 
himself, colored blue, while player X gets the other half of the screen, colored red. I tried to log my progress, which is why there are three folders:

* Code folder
  - This contains the entire project.
* Documents folder:
  - This contains a Word document that breaks down the project. It includes where I stopped, what I achieved, what I want to implement, and my thought process.
  It also contains another folder with numerous Word files. The titles used are the dates on which I worked on the project. 01.05.2024 was the date the project was completed.
* Pics folder
  - This also includes my drawings of the game and image illustrating the game's logic.

Here you will find the project that I made to test my knowledge and implement something that I learned.
Each project folder will have a word document in it.
The document will contain mainly:
- What I wanted to create.
- How I approached the project.
- My problems along the way and if I fixed them.
- Also time used to finish the project.
#Please note that some projects were completed over non-consecutive days
